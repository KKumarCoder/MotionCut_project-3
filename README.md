# MotionCut_project-3
As we embark on Week 3 of your internship program, I am excited to introduce the project that will
further enhance your skills in Web development, specifically focusing on HTML and CSS. The
upcoming task is the creation of a "E-commerce Product Page" as part of your Web development
internship.
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an E-commerce Product page.
